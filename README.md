## SQL Basics

This repository uses common SQL techniques, including:
- Creating tables
- Adding data
- Connecting tables with foreign keys

## Data Sources

- **Customer Analysis**: Hypothetical customer and order information.
  - Includes customer names, emails, and their orders.
- **Employee Analysis**: Fictional employee records from a fictional company.
  - Contains details like department and salary.
- **Instagram Clone**: Data from a simulated social media app.
  - Users, photos, and comments are fabricated for the project.
- **TV Series Analysis**: Fictional TV series data and reviewer ratings.
  - Tracks reviews given to various shows.

## Tools

- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**:
  - Used for creating databases and tables, managing data, and querying data for analysis.
  - Simulates real-world scenarios like customer orders, employee records, social media data, and TV series reviews.

## Data Cleaning

- **Removing Duplicates**: Ensures no duplicate entries in tables.
- **Standardizing Data**: Maintains a consistent format for data.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Ensures all required fields are filled or default values are set.
- **Enforcing Data Types**: Uses appropriate data types to prevent incorrect entries.
- **Data Validation**: Maintains valid relationships between tables using foreign keys.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Summary Statistics**: Basic calculations like counting entries and summarizing amounts.
- **Grouping Data**: Analyzing data by categories.
- **Trend Analysis**: Checking patterns over time.
- **Filtering Data**: Focusing on specific subsets.
- **Data Relationships**: Analyzing connections between tables.

## Data Analysis

- **Aggregation**: Summing values for key metrics.
- **Averages**: Calculating averages for ratings or salaries.
- **Counting**: Counting the number of entries.
- **Sorting**: Ranking data to identify highest or lowest values.
- **Joins**: Combining data from multiple tables for deeper insights.

## Results

- **Customer Insights**: Identified purchase behavior, top spenders, and frequent buyers.
- **Employee Analysis**: Gained insights into salary distribution and highest-paid roles.
- **Social Media Activity**: Tracked user engagement in the Instagram clone.
- **TV Series Ratings**: Analyzed ratings and reviewer activity.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensured accurate data relationships for meaningful analysis.

## Recommendations

- **Improve Data Quality**: Regularly clean and validate data.
- **Analyze Trends Over Time**: Perform time-based analysis for metrics.
- **Optimize Queries**: Ensure efficient SQL queries.
- **Enhance Data Visualization**: Use tools like Power BI or Tableau for insights.
- **Expand Dataset**: Incorporate diverse data for deeper analysis.
